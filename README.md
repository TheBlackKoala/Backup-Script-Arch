This is a backupscript.
It is built for use on arch-linux. Specifically a gnome-desktop environment 
but should work for all arch-users.
The main arch-specific backup-part is the use of pacman to output all 
installed packages as to easily restore these in the case of building a new 
system.
The rest should be general for linux.

Please feel free to come with suggestions or ask for help with the script.

The idea is based on the script created by David Both: https://github.com/opensourceway/rsync-backup-script
